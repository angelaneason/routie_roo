# Smart Auto-Routing User Guide

## What is Smart Auto-Routing?

Smart Auto-Routing is a powerful feature that automatically creates optimized weekly routes based on your contact schedules. Instead of manually planning the same routes every week, you can schedule which contacts you visit on which days, and Routie Roo will automatically generate optimized routes for you.

**Perfect for:**
- Physical therapists with recurring weekly visits
- Sales representatives with regular client check-ins
- Service providers with scheduled maintenance visits
- Anyone who visits the same contacts on a predictable schedule

### Step 3: View Your Smart Routing Dashboard

1. Click **Smart Routing** (⚡ icon) in the sidebar navigation
2. You'll see three main sections:

   **Summary Cards:**
   - Total scheduled contacts
   - Number of auto-generated routes
   - Active days of the week

   **Weekly Schedule:**

1. **Your Hop Library** (main route list on Plan Routes page)
   - Routes are named like: "Monday Route - Week of Dec 9, 2024"
   - They appear alongside your manually created routes
   - Filter by folder if you assigned one in Settings

2. **Smart Routing Dashboard**
   - Shows only auto-generated routes
   - Organized by week
   - Quick access to view and navigate routes

## How It Works

### Route Generation

Smart Auto-Routing creates routes based on your schedule:

- **When**: Routes are generated automatically for the current week
- **Naming**: Routes are named by day and week (e.g., "Monday Route - Week of Dec 9, 2024")
- **Optimization**: If enabled, routes are optimized for shortest distance
- **Starting Point**: Uses your default starting point from Settings (or none if not set)
- **Folder**: Routes are saved to your default folder (or no folder if not set)

### Route Updates

- **Adding contacts**: If you schedule a new contact for a day that already has a route, they're automatically added to that route
- **Removing contacts**: If you unschedule a contact, they're removed from future routes (existing routes remain unchanged)
- **Manual changes**: You can still manually edit auto-generated routes (add/remove stops, reorder, etc.)

### Weekly Cycle

- Routes are created for the **current week** (Monday through Sunday)
- Each week gets a new set of routes
- Old routes remain in your library for reference and record-keeping

## Managing Scheduled Contacts

### View Scheduled Days

Look for the **badge** on contact cards showing scheduled days:
- "Mon" = Scheduled for Mondays
- "Mon, Wed, Fri" = Scheduled for multiple days

### Edit Schedule

1. Click the **📅 Schedule** button on any contact card
2. Check/uncheck days as needed
3. Click **Save**

### Remove from Schedule

1. Click the **📅 Schedule** button
2. Uncheck all days
3. Click **Save**

The contact will be removed from future auto-generated routes.

## Settings & Configuration

- Leave blank if you don't use folders

### Default Starting Point

Set your starting location for all auto-generated routes:
- Uses your saved starting points from Settings
- Applied to all auto-generated routes automatically
- Leave as "None" if starting points vary

### Auto-Optimize Routes

When enabled:
- Routes are automatically optimized for shortest distance
- Stops are reordered for efficiency
- Saves time and fuel costs

When disabled:
- Stops appear in the order contacts are listed
- Useful if you have specific visit order requirements

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Started

1. **Start small**: Schedule 5-10 contacts first to test the feature
2. **Check your routes**: Review auto-generated routes before using them
3. **Adjust as needed**: Fine-tune your schedule based on actual route performance

### Scheduling Strategy

- **Group by area**: Schedule contacts in the same geographic area for the same day
- **Balance workload**: Distribute contacts evenly across the week
- **Consider travel time**: Don't over-schedule any single day

### Route Management

- **Review weekly**: Check your Smart Routing Dashboard at the start of each week
- **Add to Calendar**: Use the "Add to Calendar" button to sync routes with Google Calendar
- **Track completion**: Mark stops as complete during route execution

### Optimization Tips

- **Enable auto-optimize**: Let Routie Roo find the most efficient route order
- **Set starting point**: Ensures routes start from the right location
- **Use folders**: Keep auto-generated routes separate from manual routes

## Troubleshooting

### "No routes are being created"

**Check:**
1. Is Smart Auto-Routing enabled in Settings?
2. Have you scheduled any contacts?
3. Do scheduled contacts have valid addresses?

**Solution:**
- Go to Settings → Routes → Enable Smart Auto-Routing
- Schedule at least one contact for a day of the week
- Verify contacts have addresses (click Edit to add)

### "Routes don't include all my scheduled contacts"

**Check:**
1. Are contacts marked as "Active"? (Inactive contacts are excluded)
2. Do contacts have valid addresses?
3. Are they scheduled for the correct day?

**Solution:**
- Click the eye icon on contact cards to toggle active status
- Add addresses to contacts missing them
- Edit schedule to verify correct days are selected

### "Routes aren't optimized"

**Check:**
1. Is "Auto-Optimize Routes" enabled in Settings?
2. Are you viewing an old route created before enabling optimization?

**Solution:**
- Go to Settings → Routes → Enable "Auto-Optimize Routes"
- New routes will be optimized automatically
- Use "Re-optimize" button on existing routes

### "I want to change a route but it's auto-generated"

**Solution:**
Auto-generated routes can be edited just like manual routes:
- Add or remove stops using the "Add Contact" button
- Edit stop details (address, phone, stop type)
- Reorder stops by dragging or using position numbers
- Changes only affect that specific route, not future auto-generated routes

### "Routes are missing my starting point"

**Check:**
1. Is a default starting point selected in Settings?
2. Is the starting point address valid?

**Solution:**
- Go to Settings → Routes → Set "Default Starting Point"
- Or create a saved starting point first in Settings
- New routes will include the starting point automatically

## Frequently Asked Questions

**A:** Yes! Auto-generated routes can be edited just like any other route. Add stops, remove stops, reorder, change details - all edits are preserved.

**A:** Changes apply to **future routes only**. Existing routes remain unchanged. If you unschedule a contact, they won't appear in next week's routes.

### Q: Can I schedule the same contact for multiple days?
**A:** Yes! Check multiple days when scheduling. The contact will appear in routes for each selected day.

### Q: Do auto-generated routes sync to Google Calendar?
**A:** Not automatically. Click the "Add to Calendar" button on each route to add it to Google Calendar.

### Q: Can I disable Smart Auto-Routing temporarily?
**A:** Yes! Go to Settings → Routes → Toggle "Enable Smart Auto-Routing" to OFF. Your scheduled contacts remain saved, but no new routes will be created.

### Q: What happens to old auto-generated routes?
**A:** They remain in your route library for reference. You can archive or delete them like any other route.

### Q: Can I use Smart Auto-Routing with manual routes?
**A:** Absolutely! Smart Auto-Routing and manual route creation work side-by-side. Both types of routes appear in your route library.

### Q: How do I know which routes are auto-generated?
**A:** Auto-generated routes are named with the day and week (e.g., "Monday Route - Week of Dec 9, 2024"). They also appear in the Smart Routing Dashboard.
